My job experience has been diverse and has allowed me to develop skills in various areas. It all started when I worked as an Admin Assistant for the Technical Facilities Administration (TFA) at ABS-CBN Network from 2018 to 2019. In this role, I was responsible for releasing and receiving devices and managing the inventory of devices. This experience taught me how to manage multiple tasks efficiently and how to work collaboratively with different teams.

After my stint in ABS-CBN, I moved on to work as a Senior Sales Operation Support in Great Sierra Dev.Corp from 2019 to 2022. Here, I handled purchase orders and sales orders, and I validated monthly overpayments to ensure the accuracy of financial records. This experience taught me how to be detail-oriented and organized in managing financial transactions.

Subsequently, I became a Programmer in the M.I.S Department of Solid Service Electronic at Araneta Ave, QC in 2022. I created programs that generate reports, and I was responsible for the implementation, debugging, and testing phases of the system or application. This role allowed me to develop my technical skills and attention to detail, as well as how to work independently and solve complex problems.

I remained in the same company as a Programmer from 2022 to the present, where I continue to create programs that generate reports and assist in the implementation, debugging, and testing phases of the system or application. This experience has allowed me to deepen my expertise in the technical field and gain a better understanding of the importance of creating efficient systems and applications.

Lastly, I worked as a freelance Graphic/Layout Artist at PRU Life UK, an insurance company, from 2022 to 2023. In this role, I created sales and recruitment posters for agents and made eye-catching posters to attract potential clients. This experience taught me how to communicate ideas visually and creatively, as well as how to manage my time effectively and work on multiple projects simultaneously.

Overall, my job experience has provided me with opportunities to develop various skills, such as teamwork, organization, attention to detail, creativity, adaptability, and technical expertise. These skills have helped me in every aspect of my career, and I am excited to see where my future endeavors will take me.
